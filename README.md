# ar-spiderman-filters

ARSpiderManFilters is a native iOS augmented reality prototype written in Swift that demonstartes face tracking with RealityKit by anchoring masks of Spider Man, Venom, and Vulture to the users face. Upon successfully anchoring a mask, users are given instructions on how to interact with Spider Man's robot spider and the Vulture's wings.
